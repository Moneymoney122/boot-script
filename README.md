# boot-script

- A boot script I made for personal use. But anyone can use it, if you do use it, use it at your own risk.

- "test-boot.sh" is the testing version that I'm adding to and changing constantly.

- "boot"sh is the stable and current version.

- "old-boot.sh" is the old, orignal one.

- If you notice any issues, please open an issue.
