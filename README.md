# boot-script

- A boot script I made for personal use. But anyone can use it, if you do use it, use it at your own risk.

"test-boot.sh" is the testing version that I'm adding to and changing constantly.

- "boot"sh is the stable and current version.

- "old-boot.sh" is the old, orignal one.

- Currently at 02/10/2022 (DD/MM/YY) at 22:49:00 the script does not work, if you want to use it (at your own risk), use "old-boot.sh".
 - Update at 04/10/2022 (DD/MM/YYYY) at 00:18:00 the script has been fixed, testing is appreciated and please open an issue if you find any issues

- If you notice any issues, please open an issue.
